This is the homework for week 8 of Penn's Boot Camp. It is a multiplayer online game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that uses Firebase to store the answers. 

It should be noted that for this weeks class, we were given a recommended homework assignment, and a challenge assignment. I chose the latter. 

TECHNOLOGIES: 
<ul>
<li> HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
</ul>

NOTABLE REQUIREMENTS: 
<ul>
<li>Utilizes Firebase to provide a multiplayer game </li>
<li>Players names and choices are stored in Firebase</li>
<li>Wins, Losses, and Ties are tracked for each player</li>
<li>A fully functional chat that allows players to taunt each other</li>
<li>Show/Hide fields when a player enters the game</li>
</ul>

KNOWN ISSUES: 
<ul> 
<li>No styling/CSS</li>
<li>Need to add a listener in Firebase to change the game state to false if both players leave the game (essentially a Reset)</li>
<li>Would like to replace the modals with some code that determines which, if any, player is in the game and presents them to their own fields when the game starts</li>
</ul>

BACKLOG: 
<ul>
<li>test and tweak mobile responsiveness not handled by bootstrap</li>
<li>Need to add a listener in Firebase to change the game state to false if both players leave the game (essentially a Reset)</li>

</ul>
